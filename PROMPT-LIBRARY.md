AI automatically provides: Root cause, explanation, and fix
```

**For Code Generation:**
```
Type your intent clearly:
‚ùå "firewall rule"
‚úì "allow incoming HTTPS traffic on port 443 from IP 192.168.1.100"

AI provides: Exact command with proper syntax
```

**For Optimization:**
```
Select: Slow query + EXPLAIN output
AI provides: Index recommendations, query rewrites, performance tips
```

### Platform-Specific Tips

| Platform Type | Best Practice | Example |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| SSH Terminals | Include command that failed + error output | `systemctl status myapp` + full error |
| Databases | Include error code + query | `Error 1062` + `INSERT` statement |
| IDEs | Include file path from error + stack trace | Full TypeScript compiler error |
| Notebooks | Include cell output + data info | Error + `df.info()` output |
| Kubernetes | Include pod name + describe output | `kubectl describe pod xyz` output |

### Iteration Tips

1. **First attempt unclear?** Click "Generate" to refine the response
2. **Need more context?** Select additional surrounding text
3. **Want different approach?** Modify the prompt text in the modal before clicking "Generate"
4. **Platform-specific needs?** Add a site-specific prompt in settings for that domain
