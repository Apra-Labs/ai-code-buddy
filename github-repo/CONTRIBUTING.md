2. **Search existing requests**: Look through [feature requests](https://github.com/Apra-Labs/ai-code-buddy/labels/enhancement)
3. **Consider the scope**: Is this useful for most users?

### How to Suggest

3. Explain your proposed solution

5. Consider alternatives

### Good Feature Request Example

```
Title: [FEATURE] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

Problem:
Having to click buttons interrupts my workflow. Keyboard shortcuts would be faster.

Proposed Solution:
- Ctrl+Shift+A: Send to AI
- Ctrl+Shift+I: Insert improved script
- Ctrl+Shift+E: Open extension popup

Use Case:
As a developer working in Cloud Shell, I frequently send errors to AI.
With keyboard shortcuts, I could:
1. See error
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+A (no mouse needed)
3. Review response
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+I to insert

Benefits:
- Faster workflow
- No context switching
- Power user friendly
```

Title: [QUESTION] How to use custom AI models with Ollama?

Question:
I want to use my fine-tuned Llama model with AI Code Buddy. Is this possible?

What I've Tried:
- Read the Quick Start Guide
- Checked API Keys documentation
- Found Ollama section but unclear about custom models

Context:
- Running Ollama locally
- Have custom model: my-llama-v2
- Model works in command line: `ollama run my-llama-v2`

Specific Question:
Can I enter "my-llama-v2" in the model field, or does it only work
with official Ollama models?
```

```
Title: [DOCS] Clarify Gemini API key creation steps

Page: api-keys.html - Gemini section

Issue:
Step 2 says "Click Create API Key" but the actual button
text is "Get API key" in Google AI Studio.

Suggested Fix:
Change step 2 to:
"Click 'Get API key' button (top right)"

Also add note:
"Note: Google AI Studio interface may vary slightly.
Look for 'Get API key' or 'Create API Key' button."
```
