## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done!

That's it! You're now saving time with AI-assisted RPort scripting.

## Common First-Time Issues

### "I don't see any buttons"
- Make sure you're on an RPort page
- Refresh the page (F5)
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Try setting custom selectors in Settings tab

### "CORS error"
- For Claude: Headers are automatically included
- For custom providers: Check their CORS policy
- Try Ollama instead (no CORS issues)

### "Connection test failed"
- Double-check your API key
- Make sure you copied the entire key
- Check provider status page
- Try a different provider

### "Buttons keep repeating"
- This was fixed in v2.0.0
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click reload on the extension
- Refresh your RPort page

## Pro Tips ðŸ’¡

### Conversational Context
The AI remembers your last 5 attempts! If a script fails:
1. Click "Send to AI" on the error
2. AI will see what you tried before
3. AI won't repeat the same mistake
4. You get a better solution!

### Privacy Mode
Want **complete privacy**? Use Ollama:
- âœ… Runs 100% on your computer
- âœ… No API key needed
- âœ… No network requests
- âœ… FREE forever

```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama  # Mac
# or download from ollama.ai

# Pull a model
ollama pull codellama

# Configure extension
Endpoint: http://localhost:11434
Model: codellama
```

### Custom Selectors
If RPort uses non-standard HTML:
1. Open extension popup
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Find "Custom Selectors"
4. Enter CSS selectors for output/input areas
5. Save and refresh page

### Multiple Providers
You can switch providers anytime:
1. Click extension icon
2. Select different provider
3. Enter that provider's API key
4. Save

Settings are remembered per-provider!
